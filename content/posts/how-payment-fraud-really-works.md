Payment fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem affecting businesses worldwide. Every week I investigate schemes that sound different on the surface but share the same playbook: **create urgency, intercept trust, and move value fast**.

## The Scale of the Problem

![Statistics](/images/stats-graphic.svg)

According to recent studies:
- **$32B+** Global payment fraud losses annually
- **400%** Increase in SIM swap attacks (2024)
- **4 minutes** Average time to complete OTP fraud

## Common Attack Vectors

### üìû Phone Social Engineering
Pretend to be bank staff and ask for OTP to "unlock" account. Uses data breach information to build credibility.

## Real-World Case Studies

### Case A: "Bank Manager" OTP Scam
Victim receives a call from someone claiming to be their bank's risk officer, requesting the OTP "to verify identity." The victim, frightened of losing money, reads the OTP. Within minutes, funds are transferred out.

**Prevention:** Banks never ask for OTPs under any circumstances. Hang up, call the bank's official number, and verify.

### Case B: Cloned E-commerce + Fake 3-D Secure
Social media posts advertise "70% off ‚Äî limited to 2 minutes." Victim enters card details and is redirected to a fake 3-D Secure page.

**Prevention:** Type retailer URLs manually, verify HTTPS, and check certificate validity.

## Tips for Consumers

- Never share OTPs or card CVV over phone or chat
- Use app push approvals or TOTP (authenticator apps) instead of SMS
- Prefer virtual cards or single-use card numbers for online purchases
- Lock your SIM with carrier PIN and enable port-out protection
- Verify URLs and SSL certificates before entering card details
- Enable instant alerts and reconcile statements daily

## Tips for Merchants

- Harden third-party scripts (CSP, Subresource Integrity)
- Monitor gift card activity for rapid redemptions or unusual patterns
- Use payment gateways with strong 3-D Secure flows and tokenization
- Deploy device fingerprinting and behavioral analytics
